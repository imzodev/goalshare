# Product Guidelines

## Communication Tone & Voice

- **User-Selectable Persona:** The primary voice of the platform is adaptable. Users can choose the "Coach Persona" that best motivates them (e.g., tough love, nurturing, data-driven).
- **Core Values:** Regardless of the selected persona, the platform remains encouraging, inclusive, and focused on empowering the user through their growth journey.

## Visual Identity & Design Principles

- **Clean Minimalism:** A focus on reducing cognitive load by prioritizing white space, clear typography, and removing unnecessary clutter to keep the focus on progress.
- **Accessibility & Inclusivity:** Adherence to WCAG standards to ensure the platform is usable by everyone. Design choices must consider color contrast, screen reader compatibility, and intuitive navigation.

## AI Interaction Guidelines

- **Hybrid Interaction Model:** The AI coach operates in both proactive and reactive modes.
  - **Proactive Nudging:** The AI monitors patterns and provides gentle, observational nudges when habits are missed.
  - **Reactive Support:** The AI remains available on-demand for specific advice or deep-dive conversations initiated by the user.

## User Experience (UX) Strategy

- **Frictionless Entry:** Designing for "speed to value." Reducing the steps required to log progress or start a new task.
- **Deep Reflection:** While entry is fast, the platform creates intentional spaces for users to pause and provide meaningful context to their milestones and reflections.

## Community & Social Dynamics

- **Public by Default (Privacy Enabled):** To maximize accountability, goals and progress are shared with the community by default. However, users retain full control and can set specific goals or updates to private.
- **Supportive Ecosystem:** Social interactions are curated to be positive and growth-oriented, focusing on encouragement and shared wins.
- **Structured Collaboration:** Beyond social feeds, the platform emphasizes collaborative challenges and shared group milestones to build collective momentum.
